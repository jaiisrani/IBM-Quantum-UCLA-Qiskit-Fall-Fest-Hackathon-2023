# IBM-Quantum-UCLA-Qiskit-Fall-Fest-Hackathon-2023

Thrilled to be a member in the Second Prize-winning team of the groundbreaking QCSA Fall Fest 2023 Hackathon hosted by IBM Quantum and UCLA from October 17th-27th, 2023 fueled by a deep passion for quantum computing! Our research revolves around the impact of Qiskit Pulse on coherence and fidelity. Delving into pulse sequences, error correction, and hardware intricacies, our goal is to elevate quantum system performance. By contributing to the development of robust quantum algorithms and error-correcting computations, we're shaping the future of quantum computing!
